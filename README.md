### Usage
Build with `make` or `make compile`

Build, run against test bench, and display averages with `./test.sh`

### Overview
For our term project, we were tasked with researching, implementing, and optimizing the Rivest- Shamir-Adleman (RSA) Cryptography algorithm on a 32-bit ARM processor, by analyzing and improving the implementationâ€™s assembly-level code to reduce operations and leverage optimization techniques to identify bottlenecks and increase overall performance.
